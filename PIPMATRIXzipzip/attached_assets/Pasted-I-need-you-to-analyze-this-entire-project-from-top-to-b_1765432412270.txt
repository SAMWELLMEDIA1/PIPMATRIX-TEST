I need you to analyze this entire project from top to bottom, both frontend and backend, and rebuild everything that is missing or broken. The website was cloned from an old site, so many parts are still showing dummy data and missing backend logic.
Here is EXACTLY what I need you to do:
1. FULL PROJECT SCAN
Scan all files:
All frontend pages
All components
All scripts
All backend routes
All backend controllers
All models
All utilities
All APIs
Identify:
Missing backend logic
Wrong fetch calls
Routes that do not exist
Static HTML values
Hardcoded dummy data
Unlinked features
Any leftover code from the cloned website
You must fix ALL of it.
2. REMOVE ALL DUMMY DATA
Delete ALL hardcoded or pre-filled data across every page, including:
Dummy notifications
Dummy BTC balance (currently showing 4 million)
Dummy withdrawal history
Dummy deposit history
Dummy account statement
Dummy trades
Dummy user profile
Any saved data from the previous website
Everything must be reset to ZERO / EMPTY unless the new user actually performs an action.
3. REBUILD THE BACKEND PERFECTLY
You must rebuild ALL backend logic needed for every page to work properly.
Create or fix backend routes for:
User System
POST /register
POST /login
GET /user/:id
PUT /user/:id/update
Wallet & Transactions
GET /user/:id/balance → default should be 0
GET /user/:id/deposits
GET /user/:id/withdrawals
GET /user/:id/statements
POST /deposit
POST /withdraw
POST /trade
Notifications
GET /user/:id/notifications
POST /notifications/create → automatically triggered when:
User deposits
User withdraws
Admin approves something
User opens a trade
Trade closes
Balance updates
Make sure:
All responses are real dynamic data
No static or hardcoded JSON responses
Each user only sees their own data
4. FIX ALL FRONTEND FETCH CALLS
Every page that loads data must use API calls only, not dummy HTML.
Examples:
Deposit History Page
Fetch from /user/:id/deposits
Withdrawal History Page
Fetch from /user/:id/withdrawals
Account Statement Page
Fetch from /user/:id/statements
Notifications Page
Fetch from /user/:id/notifications
If empty → show “No notifications yet”
Dashboard
Fetch:
User profile
Balance (default 0)
Latest transactions
Notifications count
Remove the hardcoded BTC balance (4,000,000).
Set it to 0 unless backend returns a real number.
5. RESET NOTIFICATIONS
Right now:
Notifications list is empty
But clicking still shows old notifications from the cloned site
You must:
Remove ALL old notification data completely
Ensure the notifications page loads ONLY from backend
Make notification list EMPTY for new users
Automatically generate notifications when real actions happen
6. FIX ANY “FAILED TO FETCH” ERRORS
Check:
API endpoints
CORS settings
Body parser
HTTP methods
Missing routes
Wrong URLs
Incorrect port
Missing database functions
Every fetch should work correctly with the backend.
7. FINAL TESTING
After fixing everything:
Register a new user
Log in
Dashboard displays only new user data
All pages are empty until user performs actions
Deposit → appears in deposit history + notification
Withdrawal → appears in withdrawal history + notification
Trade → appears and updates account
No dummy data anywhere
No leftover cloned content
No broken pages
No “Failed to fetch”
