“I want you to rebuild the entire crypto payment system on my website using my real wallet addresses below. Remove all old wallet addresses, dummy wallets, old QR codes, and any outdated payment logic. Replace EVERYTHING with these new wallets only:
BTC: bc1q8a07p9n6xlwvaare2a9dghtvtk5zd232ca55q0
ETH: 0x11722310395Dd27de946F5B87F79da16Ea2fdECe
BNB: 0x11722310395Dd27de946F5B87F79da16Ea2fdECe
SOLANA: GdLjdGR6GWxPoYDvfvLbfAgNhNDMNE3B6sXCzrwHCT8r
DOGE: DPN2z9snmiM7w3bqkHqRS8NJiYyHYE4Js8
USDT (TRC20): TMWtrR9eAe1crQyyUoF1E9eZBaanxCDTs1
XRP: rUBFJqt1WCcYH88o7keaRV5CBoKAaA5AC
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
1. Detect Crypto Type + Network Automatically
When a user selects a payment option:
Detect correct crypto name
Detect correct network (BTC, ETH, BNB Chain, Solana, TRC20, DOGE, XRP)
Load the right wallet address automatically
Validate the format so no wrong network shows the wrong wallet
2. Generate QR Codes Dynamically
For each wallet above, generate a QR code using a QR library.
The QR code must encode the EXACT wallet address with no mistakes.
3. Build the Payment Page UI + Logic
When a user clicks “Pay with BTC/ETH/USDT/etc”, open a new page that shows:
The selected cryptocurrency
My wallet address (correct one)
The generated QR code
The network name
Input for “Transaction Hash / TXID”
File upload for payment screenshot/receipt
A submit button
After submit:
Save deposit request in backend
Attach TXID + receipt file
Store crypto type + network
Show it in Deposit History as “Pending”
Notify admin
4. Remove All Dummy Payment Data
Delete any leftover:
old QR images
old wallet addresses
old payment API endpoints
hardcoded example deposits
cloned-site payment files
unused crypto networks
Everything must use ONLY my wallet addresses above.
5. Make the Payment System Error-Proof
Never mix networks (example: USDT-ERC20 must NOT show TRC20 wallet)
Never display wrong wallet address
No hardcoded sample deposits
No placeholder addresses
Make sure backend receives real user inputs
Important Final Instructions
DO NOT change my wallet addresses.
DO NOT add any dummy wallets.
DO NOT add fake QR codes.
Use my real wallet addresses only.
Return the updated code and tell me where changes were made.
