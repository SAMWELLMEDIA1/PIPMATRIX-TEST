**I want you to modify my project with the following features:**

### **1. In the dashboard**

* In the section that shows:
  **“Account Verified — Your identity has been verified. All features are now available.”**
  add a **“Connect Wallet”** button.
* When the button is clicked, it must **redirect to `CONNECT.html`**.

---

### **2. Redesign `CONNECT.html`**

### **3. Wallet Modal UI Requirements**

**Top:** Wallet name (example: “Trust Wallet”)
**Below it:**

```

starting secure connection...
please wait...
```

* Show a **loading animation** for 10 seconds.
* After 10 seconds, display an error message:

```
An error occurred... please try again or connect manually.
```

* Include **two buttons**:

  * **Try Again**
  * **Connect Manually**

### **4. If “Connect Manually” is clicked**

Show a new UI state inside the modal:

```
This session is secured and encrypted
```

* Show an input box with placeholder:

```
Enter your 12 or 24 Mnemonic words. Separate them with spaces.
You can also input your private key instead.
```

* Below the input box add a **Connect** button.

### **5. Connection Simulation**

* When Connect is clicked:

  * Show **“connecting…”** for 5 seconds.
  * Then show **“Connected”**.
  * The selected wallet on the page should now display **Connected** status visually.

### **6. Keep everything clean and responsive**

* Modal must be centered, blurred background.
* Smooth fade-in / fade-out animations.
* Use modern UI (rounded corners, soft shadows, gradients, etc.).

---

### **7. Provide full code**

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Include all animations and timing logic.
* Make sure it works in Replit instantly with no missing files.
